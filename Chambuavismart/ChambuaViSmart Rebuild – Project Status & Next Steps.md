# ChambuaViSmart Rebuild – Project Status & Next Steps

Date: 2025-09-01 10:23 (local)

This report summarizes the current state of the ChambuaViSmart rebuild (No ML), progress against the blueprint, and the recommended next steps to reach P1–P3 milestones.

---

## Project Overview
- Scope: Full rebuild of the existing application with deterministic logic and the same UI/UX and backend functionality, explicitly excluding all ML features (see “ChambuaViSmart Rebuild Blueprint (No ML)”).
- Goal: Implement the frontend and backend to mirror the original app’s look and behavior, using only non‑ML logic for analytics and predictions.
- Source of truth: ChambuaViSmart_Rebuild_Blueprint_NoML.md.

## Milestone Tracking (Blueprint Section 11)
Legend: [x] Completed, [~] In Progress, [ ] Pending

### P0 Foundations
- [~] Project scaffolding
  - Backend Spring Boot app present (main class + HealthController) ✓
  - Angular frontend app with routing and shell components ✓
- [~] Routing
  - Angular routes defined for Home, Fixtures, Teams, Matchup, League, xG, Advice, History, Admin + extra pages ✓
- [~] DB connectivity & config
  - application.yml configured for MySQL; Flyway enabled ✓
  - docker-compose: MySQL service only (no app services yet) ~
  - No migration scripts found (db/migration missing) ✗
- [ ] Migrations/seed data
  - V1__init.sql not present ✗

Status: Partially complete. Missing DB migrations and app Dockerfiles/compose services.

### P1 Core Flows
- [ ] Today’s Fixtures (UI + /api/fixtures/today)
- [ ] Team Profiles (UI + /api/teams/profile and aggregated profile)
- [ ] Matchup Analyzer (UI + /api/matchup/analyze)
- [ ] League Table & Momentum (UI + /api/league-table/*)
- [ ] Advice Display (UI + /api/betting-recommendations/recommendation)

Status: Routes/components scaffolded but all are placeholders; backend endpoints not implemented yet.

### P2 Analytics & History
- [ ] xG History & Insights (UI + /api/xg-history/*)
- [ ] Match History (UI + /api/match-history/*)
- [ ] Data Ingestion/Admin (upload CSV, raw text/H2H)

Status: Not implemented (UI placeholders, no endpoints).

### P3 Enhancements
- [ ] Exports & reporting
- [ ] Caching & performance
- [ ] Accessibility audits and fine‑tuning

Status: Not started (blueprint guidance available).

### Styling & UI/UX
- Global navbar and footer present.
- Theming and exact styles from Section 2.3 not yet applied beyond basic styles in navbar.

### Routing & Navigation

## Issues / Observations
- Missing DB migration files (Flyway is enabled but classpath:db/migration is empty). This will fail on startup if schema is required.
- Backend feature controllers/services are not present; only HealthController is implemented.
- Frontend components are placeholders; no service calls or models are implemented.
- docker-compose sets up MySQL but does not define backend/frontend services; Dockerfiles are absent.
- CORS and proxy details not yet configured in the frontend (proxy.conf.json per blueprint).

Recommendations:
- Create Flyway baseline migration V1__init.sql covering core tables (Section 6) and minimal seed data for dev.
- Implement P1 endpoints first with deterministic logic (Sections 3 and 5).
- Add Angular services and models, then wire UI components to backend.
- Add Dockerfiles and extend docker-compose to include backend and frontend services.

---

## Next Steps / Suggested Plan
Prioritized according to the blueprint roadmap.

### Immediate (Complete P0)
1) Add Flyway baseline migration (V1__init.sql) for core tables and indexes.
2) Verify Spring Boot connects to MySQL (dev) and migrates; add simple seed data for fixtures.
3) Add Dockerfile.backend and Dockerfile.frontend; extend docker-compose with app services; verify local startup with compose.

### P1 Core Flows (Implement Endpoints + UI)
1) Fixtures
   - Controllers: FixtureController with GET /api/fixtures/today and basics
   - Repository + entity for Fixture; service for normalization and querying
   - Frontend: FixturesTodayComponent with table view and navigation actions
2) Team Profiles
   - Controllers: TeamsController (search/list) + TeamProfile endpoints
   - Frontend: TeamProfileComponent with DTO models
3) Matchup Analyzer
   - Controller + deterministic analysis service (indices, classification, confidence)
   - Frontend: form + charts (bar/line) per Section 2
4) League Table & Momentum
   - Controller + cached service
   - Frontend: table with momentum and tabs
5) Advice Display
   - Controller using xG-only recommendation engine
   - Frontend: simple recommendation panel

### P2 Analytics & History
1) xG History & Insights endpoints and UI (including PATCH/PUT for actual goals)
2) Match History pagination/filtering endpoints and UI
3) Admin Upload: CSV/raw text parsing endpoints and upload UI

### P3 Enhancements
- Exports & reporting, caching layers, accessibility audits

## Commit/Push Status
- This report reflects the current working tree. Git push/merge status cannot be verified from the files alone.
- Action: After implementing the above, ensure commits reference milestones (e.g., feat(p1): fixtures today endpoint) and that CI builds are green.
