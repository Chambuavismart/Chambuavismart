# PDF Fallback Improvement Report

Date: 2025-09-13

## Changes Made

- Implemented a professional iText-based fallback PDF generator in the backend when `latexmk` is unavailable or LaTeX compilation fails.
  - Added a new rich fallback in `LaTeXService` that creates an A4 PDF with 1-inch margins, organized sections, and tables:
    - Title: “Fixture Analysis: [Team A] vs [Team B]”.
    - Section: Total Matches Played.
    - Section: Team Summaries (Metric/Value table per team).
    - Section: H2H Insights (narrative, GD, last 5 form).
    - Section: Head-to-Head Results (tables for History and All Orientations: Year, Date, Match, Result).
    - Section: Fixture Analysis Results (Outcome/Probability table).
    - Section: Most Probable Correct Scores (Score/Probability table).
  - Watermark on every page: “Powered by ChambuaVismart” at 45°, semi-transparent (opacity 0.2), centered.
  - Disabled compression on the fallback to keep text searchable for tests (only for the programmatic fallback).
  - Kept the previous tiny minimal-PDF as a tertiary safety fallback.
- Dependency updates in `backend/pom.xml` to include iText 8 modules: `kernel`, `layout`, and `io` (version 8.0.5).
- Improved LaTeX availability check in `LaTeXService` to honor `DISABLE_LATEXMK` system property or environment variable (useful for tests/CI).
- Frontend UX improvements in `played-matches-summary.component.ts`:
  - Log the outgoing payload for easier debugging.
  - Clearer error alert on failure: “PDF generation failed. Try again or check backend logs.”
- Unit test added: `LaTeXServiceTest` to verify the fallback path generates a valid PDF containing the watermark and title text when LaTeX is disabled.

## Files Touched

- backend/pom.xml
- backend/src/main/java/com/chambua/vismart/service/LaTeXService.java
- backend/src/test/java/com/chambua/vismart/service/LaTeXServiceTest.java (new)
- frontend/src/app/pages/played-matches-summary.component.ts
- pdf_fallback_improvement_report.md (this file)

## Tests Performed

- Unit Test:
  - `LaTeXServiceTest.generatesRichFallbackPdfWithWatermarkWhenLatexUnavailable` forces fallback, generates a PDF, and asserts the output is a valid PDF containing the watermark and title text.
- Manual sanity checks (by inspection):
  - Ensured all required sections and tables are included in the fallback generator.
  - Ensured margins, A4 size, and overall structure are suitable for a 1–2 page output.

## Notes on Running

- To force fallback mode (for local verification), set:
  - JVM property: `-DDISABLE_LATEXMK=true` or environment variable `DISABLE_LATEXMK=true` before running the backend.

## New Suggestions

- Add a lightweight HTML-to-PDF alternative (e.g., OpenPDF or Flying Saucer) for environments where iText licensing is a concern.
- Add team logos (if available) and optional league branding in the header of the PDF.
- Provide a “Preview PDF” option in the UI that opens the generated PDF in a new tab instead of immediate download.
- Add pagination logic to split very long H2H tables across pages with repeated headers.
- Include a small footer with generation date/time and app version.
