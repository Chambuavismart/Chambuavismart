# ChambuaViSmart Rebuild – Current Status & Next Steps (Generated 2025-09-01)

Date: 2025-09-01 10:27 (local)

Summary (TL;DR)
- Overall progress: ~28% (P0 ≈ 60%, P1 ≈ 5%, P2 0%, P3 0%)
- Key blockers: No DB migrations (Flyway enabled but empty), missing feature controllers/services, no Dockerfiles for backend/frontend, limited docker-compose (DB only), frontend services/models not created, no proxy config.
- Ready items: Health endpoint live; Angular shell, routing, navbar/footer in place; status documents present. Next immediate tasks: add Flyway baseline + seeds, implement Fixtures Today endpoint and UI, wire Angular services, add Dockerfiles and compose services.

## 1) Project Overview
- Scope: Full rebuild of the existing application with deterministic logic (no ML) to match existing UI/UX and backend functionality across fixtures, team profiles, matchup analysis, league stats, xG analytics, recommendations, history, and data ingestion.
- Goals: Implement exact UI/UX and endpoints as per the blueprint, excluding any ML features.

## 3) Component / Feature Status (Verified Against Working Tree)

Backend Services & Endpoints
| Area | Endpoint(s) (as per blueprint) | Implemented in code? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Health | GET /api/health | Yes | backend/src/main/java/.../controller/HealthController.java |
| Fixtures | /api/fixtures… | No | No FixtureController/service present |
| Fixture Predictions & xG (non‑ML) | /api/fixture-predictions… | No | Not present |
| xG History & Insights | /api/xg-history… | No | Not present |
| Team Search & Profiles | /api/teams… | No | Not present |
| League Table & Momentum | /api/league-table… | No | Not present |
| Match History | /api/match-history… | No | Not present |
| Advice/Recommendations | /api/betting-recommendations… | No | Not present |
| Data Ingestion/Admin | upload & parsing controllers | No | Not present |

Frontend Pages/Components (exact routes/files)
- Routes file: frontend/src/app/app.routes.ts
- Implemented standalone components (placeholders unless noted):
  - HomeComponent → path: ‘‘ (/) ✓
  - FixturesComponent → path: ‘/fixtures’ ✓
  - TeamsComponent → path: ‘/teams’ ✓
  - MatchupAnalyzerComponent → path: ‘/matchup’ ✓
  - LeagueTableComponent → path: ‘/league’ ✓
  - XgHistoryComponent → path: ‘/xg’ ✓
  - AdviceComponent → path: ‘/advice’ ✓
  - MatchHistoryComponent → path: ‘/history’ ✓
  - AdminUploadComponent → path: ‘/admin’ ✓
  - Additional lazy/standalone pages present in routes: ‘/match-analysis’, ‘/fixture-predictions’, ‘/analyzed-fixtures’, ‘/data-management’, ‘/btts-over25’, ‘/wekelea-baskets’, ‘/team-search’ ✓
- Layout components: frontend/src/app/layout/navbar.component.ts, footer.component.ts ✓
- Note: All feature pages are placeholders (simple templates). No services/models wired yet.

Styling & UI/UX
- Navbar styles partially present; full theming (palette/gradients/typography) per blueprint Section 2.3 not yet applied across the app.

Routing & Navigation
- Angular router configured; navbar links cover new pages (e.g., match-analysis, fixture-predictions, analyzed-fixtures, data-management, btts-over25, wekelea-baskets, team-search).

Docker / Environment
- docker-compose.yml includes only a MySQL service. No Dockerfile.backend or Dockerfile.frontend in repo; no compose services for backend/frontend yet.

---

## 4) Issues / Observations
- Flyway is enabled but no migrations exist (classpath:db/migration is missing). This will block database-backed features.
- Only /api/health is implemented; all domain endpoints (fixtures, teams, league, xG, history, advice) are missing.
- Frontend components are placeholders with no HTTP services (no models or services in src/app/services).
- No Dockerfiles for backend/frontend; docker-compose launches MySQL only, so end-to-end spins are not available with Compose.
- Frontend proxy config (proxy.conf.json) not present; CORS is not configured in backend beyond default dev expectations.

Recommendations
- Add Flyway baseline migration V1__init.sql with core tables/indexes and minimal seed data (fixtures).
- Implement P1 endpoints first using deterministic logic; start with Fixtures Today to unblock the first UI table.
- Add Angular DTO models and services; wire Fixtures page to GET /api/fixtures/today and render table.
- Add Dockerfile.backend and Dockerfile.frontend; extend docker-compose with backend/frontend services; enable healthchecks.
- Introduce proxy.conf.json in frontend for dev to route /api → http://localhost:8082 and configure CORS in backend if necessary.

---

## 5) Next Steps / Suggested Plan (Prioritized P0 → P3)

Immediate (Complete P0)
1) Database migrations & seeds
   - Create src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql for core schema (leagues, teams, fixtures, matches, fixture_predictions, xg_analyses, team_stats, etc.) and indexes.
   - Add minimal dev seed data to enable Fixtures Today demo.
2) Dockerization for app services
   - Add Dockerfile.backend (Spring Boot, expose 8082) and Dockerfile.frontend (build Angular, serve via Nginx).
   - Extend docker-compose.yml to include backend and frontend services, wire to MySQL; add environment variables.
3) Developer experience
   - Add frontend proxy.conf.json and README instructions; verify CORS in backend for http://localhost:4200.

P1 – Core Flows (Implementation Order & Dependencies)
1) Fixtures Today (dependency: V1 schema) → minimal Fixture entity/repo/service + GET /api/fixtures/today; Angular table.
2) Team Profiles (depends on teams/matches data) → /api/teams/profile and aggregated profile; basic UI with recent matches & trends.
3) Matchup Analyzer → deterministic service + POST /api/matchup/analyze; UI form + basic charts.
4) League Table & Momentum → caching layer + GET /api/league-table/{league}; UI table + tabs.
5) Advice Display → xG-only recommendation endpoint; simple UI panel.

P2 – Analytics & History
1) xG History & Insights endpoints (+ PUT/PATCH actual goals) and UI.
2) Match History (pagination, filters) and UI.
3) Admin Upload (CSV/raw text) endpoints and upload page.

P3 – Enhancements
- Exports/reporting; caching/performance; accessibility audits.

---

## 6) Commit/Push Notes (Best Practices)
- Use conventional commits tied to milestones (e.g., feat(p1-fixtures): add GET /api/fixtures/today endpoint).
- Keep backend and frontend changes in separate commits where possible; include schema migrations in dedicated commits.
- Ensure CI validates: mvn -q -DskipTests=false test; ng build --configuration production; basic linting.
- Protect main branch; use PRs with checklist referencing blueprint sections and endpoint contracts.

---

## 7) Readiness for Push/Merge
- Report files and routing scaffolds are ready to commit/push.
- After adding V1__init.sql and minimal Fixture endpoint, changes will be ready for a P1 bootstrap PR (fixtures UI wired to live data).

---

## 8) Verification of References (Exact Names/Paths)
- Backend endpoints present: GET /api/health (HealthController.java).
- No other /api/* controllers are currently in the tree (fixtures, teams, league-table, xg-history, match-history, betting-recommendations not present yet).
- Frontend routes: defined in frontend/src/app/app.routes.ts (Home “/”, Fixtures “/fixtures”, Teams “/teams”, Matchup “/matchup”, League “/league”, xG “/xg”, Advice “/advice”, History “/history”, Admin “/admin”; plus: /match-analysis, /fixture-predictions, /analyzed-fixtures, /data-management, /btts-over25, /wekelea-baskets, /team-search).
- Layout components: frontend/src/app/layout/navbar.component.ts and footer.component.ts.
