# PDF Download with Watermark — Fix & Completion Report

## Changes Made

- Backend
  - Enhanced LaTeXService to gracefully handle environments without `latexmk`:
    - Added `isLatexAvailable()` which checks common Linux and Windows TeX Live locations and attempts `latexmk --version`.
    - If LaTeX is unavailable or compilation fails, generate a valid fallback PDF (single page) containing:
      - Title (Fixture Analysis: Home vs Away).
      - Total matches, team summaries, H2H insights and GD, predictions (Win/Draw/Loss, BTTS, Over 1.5/2.5/3.5), and top correct scores.
      - A diagonal watermark text “Powered by ChambuaVismart” in light gray.
    - Kept a minimal emergency PDF generator as last resort.
  - Kept and reused the LaTeX template (analysis.tex) with watermark via eso-pic + TikZ and Noto font.
  - Documented LaTeX requirements and PATH setup in backend/README.md (texlive-full, texlive-fonts-extra; Windows `C:\texlive\...\latexmk.exe`).

- Frontend
  - Stabilized `webpack-dev-server` reconnect behavior in `frontend/angular.json`:
    - Disabled HMR for the dev server, kept liveReload and watch.
    - Set `allowedHosts: ["all"]`.
    - Added `client.reconnect: 10` and `client.timeout: 60000` to reduce disconnections.
  - The “Download as PDF” button and request flow already existed; no changes required in component/service other than leveraging the now-stable backend.

## Tests Performed

- Build
  - Ran backend Maven package build to validate compilation with updated LaTeXService and no new dependencies.

- Backend behavior (manual reasoning tests)
  - With missing `latexmk` (typical Windows without TeX Live): `LaTeXService` detects absence and uses fallback generator, producing a valid PDF stream with title, key sections, and watermark.
  - With available `latexmk`: Uses LaTeX to compile `analysis.tex`, returning a professional PDF with the diagonal watermark and tables.

- Frontend stability
  - Updated dev-server config is expected to maintain the client connection more reliably during repeated requests and heavy console logging.

## How to Verify Locally

1. Start backend (port 8082) and frontend (port 4200).
2. In the UI, select a head-to-head pair, click “Analyse this fixture”, then click “Download as PDF”.
3. If TeX Live with `latexmk` is installed and on PATH, a professionally formatted PDF (LaTeX) should download. Otherwise, a simple fallback PDF will download with all key sections and a visible diagonal watermark.

## Notes and Limitations

- The fallback PDF is intentionally simple to avoid external library dependencies and keep builds green; it includes key content and a watermark but not full table styling.
- For higher-fidelity fallback (multi-page tables, styling, opacity control), consider integrating a PDF library (e.g., iText 7, OpenPDF, or Apache PDFBox) and expanding the fallback renderer accordingly.

## New Suggestions

1. Add a server configuration property to force fallback mode for testing regardless of LaTeX availability (e.g., `pdf.useFallback=true`).
2. Add an admin diagnostics endpoint to return LaTeX detection status and `latexmk --version` output to aid operations.
3. Optional: Include team logos in the PDF when available (upload or reference static assets); place them in headers for each team.
4. Offer a “Preview PDF” (opens in new tab) in addition to download.
5. Consider a background job queue for PDF generation if you plan to support batch exports or very large documents.
